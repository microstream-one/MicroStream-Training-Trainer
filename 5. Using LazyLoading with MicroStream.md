<h1>LazyLoading with MicroStream</h1>

<h2>Target of the unit</h2>

1. Participants should understand why it is recomendet and important to use "LazyLoading"
2. Participants should know how to design a proper object model using the "Lazy" wrapper class
3. Participants should understand the API of the "LazyLoading" functionality
4. Participants should know how to release allready loaded object

<h2>Needed preparations</h2>

1. Any java IDE or text editor
2. Maven installed or available via IDE
3. Annotation Processing enabled in the IDE (Eclipse)
4. GIT installed on the system or available via IDE

<h2>Necessary Links</h2>

1. GIT Repository: Power Point Presentation 
* https://github.com/microstream-one/MicroStream-Training-Trainer/blob/6dc1cd909ded8cc98b04cf4f6697235c362d9457/LazyLoadingWithMicroStream.pptx
3. GIT Repository: Demo Project
	* Starter branch: https://github.com/microstream-one/microstream-training-lazyloading-demo/tree/ex1-non-lazy-loading
	* LazyDemo implementation done: https://github.com/microstream-one/microstream-training-lazyloading-demo/tree/ex2-lazy-images

<h2>Explanation about the training</h2>

1. Needed preparations see above
2. Duration of the unit
3. Targets of the unit

The training consists of two parts: First part is a presentation and the second part is a demo project for live coding, hands on or just an explanation of java code. 
Depending on the available time of the training, amount of participants or programming skills of the trainer the second part could be different.

<h2>PART 1: Theoretical presentation</h2>

**Topics of the presentation:**
1. Why do we need to store and load data in a lazy way?
2. What data should be stored and loaded lazyly?
3. How to use lazy references?
4. Some best practice examples
5. How to release lazy data if no longer needed?

<h2>PART 2: Working with the demo project</h2>

1. Getting the Project from: https://github.com/microstream-one/microstream-training-lazyloading-demo.git
2. Switching to branch: "ex1-non-lazy-loading"
3. Explaining the project itself and the different classes

**Project with non lazy images leads to a java heap exception**
1. <strong>Starting the Project</strong>
      1. Switching to folder "MicroStream_LazyLoading_Demo"
      2. Call .\mvnw mn:runfrom commanline
      3. Or start Application.class as java application within an IDE
      4. Result in the console: A big Micronaut writing and 'Server Running: http://localhost:8080' at the end.
2. Starting "Java VisualVM"
      1. Going to installed JDK Folder in the system
      2. Going to the /bin folder and open the "jvisualvm.exe"
      3. Choosing the right application in VisualVM (one.microstream.Application)
      4. Switch tab to "Monitor" and disable CPU, Classes and Threads
3. Browser call: localhost:8080/books
	* Browser should be empty because there are no books in the storage
	* Required RAM extens a litte to 75 MB
4. Browser call: localhost:8080/books/create
	* Result in the browser: "Books successfully created!"
	* Required RAM extens a lot to 2000 MB
	* All images are now in the storage and in the RAM
5. Browser call: localhost:8080/books
	* Result in the browser: empty
	* Required RAM extens a lot to 4000 MB
	* Depending on your system oder IDE a JavaHeapSpace Exception could occur
	* The reason for that is: We need round two GigaByte for the images in the RAM without Lazy loading and we need another two Gigayte for the REST JSON object trasformation.

**Project with lazy images**
1. Switching to branch: "ex2-lazy-images"
2. Refresh the Project in the IDE and deleting the data folder for cleaning the storage
3. <strong>Starting the Project</strong>
      1. Switching to folder "MicroStream_LazyLoading_Demo"
      2. Call .\mvnw mn:runfrom commanline
      3. Or start Application.class as java application within an IDE
      4. Result in the console: A big Micronaut writing and 'Server Running: http://localhost:8080' at the end.
4. Closing old java thread in "Java VisualVM"
      3. Choosing the new application in VisualVM (one.microstream.Application)
      4. Switch tab to "Monitor" and disable CPU, Classes and Threads
5. Browser call: localhost:8080/books
	* Browser should be empty because there are no books in the storage
	* Required RAM extens a litte to 75 MB
6. Browser call: localhost:8080/books/create
	* Result in the browser: "Books successfully created!"
	* Required RAM extens a lot to 2000 MB
	* All images are now in the storage and in the RAM because they were initialy loaded
	* After 15 Minutes MicroStream will release this objects automatically
7. Restart the app and we will see the images will no long need RAM because they are lazyly loaded

**Release the images direktly after creation**
1. Go to "BookController" class to "createBooks()" service
2. Aktivate the two deactivated lines after the store call
```Java
DB.root.getBooks().parallelStream().map(b -> b.getImage()).forEach(l -> l.clear());
System.gc();
```
	* First line iterates over lazy images and clears the references
	* Second line call the garbage collector of Java to clean memory
3. Start the App, refresh VisualVM and we will see the memory is clear instandly after creating books with images
4. Browser call: localhost:8080/books
	* Browser shows all books
	* Required RAM should be below 200 MB
	* The reason for that is: We have our images lazy so we dont need RAM for them and the REST JSON parser dont have to serialize the images

**Release the images direktly after creation**
